Description: Time-Series Generalized Random Forests (tsGRF) extend the capabilities of traditional GRF for time-series data analysis. tsGRF offers specialized non-parametric methods tailored for heterogeneous treatment effects estimation in time-series contexts, accommodating right-censored outcomes, multiple treatment arms or outcomes, or instrumental variables. Additionally, it includes enhanced versions of least-squares regression, quantile regression, and survival regression, all optimized for time-series data with support for handling missing covariates. This adaptation ensures that tsGRF is particularly adept at capturing the dynamics and dependencies inherent in time-series data, providing robust statistical estimation and inference for complex economic and financial datasets.
