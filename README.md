# tsgrf
This is a machine learning R package for time series based on grf.

Our experiment has proved that tsgrf performed better than grf on long time series with high volatilityã€‚

The current development version can be installed from source using devtools. If you don't install devtools, you can follow this:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

```R
devtools::install_github("soso010816/tsgrf", subdir = "tsgrf0.6.1")
```

There is a example for using it.

```R
n <- 500
p <- 10
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p)
Y <- X[, 1] * rnorm(n)

# honesty.method : Specifies the method of honesty tree splitting, default is 4.
# nonlapping.block.size: Number of Blocks, The total number of blocks is calculated as n^{1/nonlapping_block_size}. 
r.forest <- regression_forest(X, Y, nonlapping.block.size=2, honesty.method=4)

# Predict using the forest.
X.test <- matrix(0, 101, p)
X.test[, 1] <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 101)
r.pred <- predict(r.forest, X.test)

# Predict on out-of-bag training samples.
r.pred <- predict(r.forest)

# Predict with confidence intervals; growing more trees is now recommended.
r.forest <- regression_forest(X, Y, num.trees = 100)
r.pred <- predict(r.forest, X.test, estimate.variance = TRUE)
```
